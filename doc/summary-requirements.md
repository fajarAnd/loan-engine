# Loan Engine - ðŸ“‹ Summary Requirements
## Core Business Rules
- **State Flow**: `proposed` â†’ `approved` â†’ `invested` â†’ `disbursed`
- **Forward-only movement**: No backward state transitions allowed
- **Multiple investors**: Each loan can have multiple investors with individual amounts
- **Investment constraint**: Total invested amount cannot exceed loan principal
- **Auto state transition**: Loan becomes `invested` when total investment equals principal
